## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Edwin, a frontend developer based in Berlin. I specialize in building modern, responsive websites and web applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next, and more.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on backend projects using Node.js and Python with the aim to transition to a full-stack developer!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m also learning advanced backend development techniques, including microservices and cloud computing.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on innovative web development projects, particularly those that involve cutting-edge frontend technologies and dynamic backend systems.
